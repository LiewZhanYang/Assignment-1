## Project: Revamp the website for Popular Online Malaysia

The motivation behind the redesign of this website stems from the recognition that its current state lacks user-friendliness and convenience. Notable issues include the difficulty in locating essential buttons, an overall lack of visual appeal, and a lack of interesting elements that could engage users effectively.

The primary goal of this revamp is to create a popular online platform that is not only convenient but also user-friendly and attractive. The existing challenges, such as the elusive button placements and the absence of captivating features, will be addressed to transform the website into a more engaging and accessible platform.

## User Audience Intent And Purpose

The user audience consists of students and individuals passionate about reading and drawing. In the past, if they needed to purchase items essential to their interests, they had to physically visit a shop. Now, with the website, they can conveniently buy their stationery and books online.
