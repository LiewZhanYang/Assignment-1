## Project: Revamp the website for Popular Online Malaysia

The motivation behind the redesign of this website stems from the recognition that its current state lacks user-friendliness and convenience. Notable issues include the difficulty in locating essential buttons, an overall lack of visual appeal, and a lack of interesting elements that could engage users effectively.

The primary goal of this revamp is to create a popular online platform that is not only convenient but also user-friendly and attractive. The existing challenges, such as the elusive button placements and the absence of captivating features, will be addressed to transform the website into a more engaging and accessible platform.

## User Audience Intent And Purpose

The user audience consists of students and individuals passionate about reading and drawing. In the past, if they needed to purchase items essential to their interests, they had to physically visit a shop. Now, with the website, they can conveniently buy their stationery and books online.

## Who The Website Is Catering For And Value Provided To Users

The primary users of the website are students who are studying and wish to purchase stationery and reference books. In the past, finding the specific reference book they needed in a physical bookstore was challenging, sometimes leading to unsuccessful searches. Additionally, the previous version of the website, before the revamp, had functionality issues and lacked attractiveness. Even after logging in, users encountered bugs that rendered the website unusable.

With the revamped website, students can now easily locate their desired books using the search button in the top navbar. The overall appearance of the website has also significantly improved compared to its previous state.

The secondary users are individuals passionate about reading and drawing. They often require specific items that may not be available in nearby physical shops, necessitating a long journey. Moreover, some of these users may struggle with navigating a complex and buggy website, particularly older individuals.

The enhanced user-friendliness of the new website addresses these challenges. Users can conveniently find everything they need on the website, and the revamped design ensures a seamless and pleasant experience. Additionally, the option to have parcels delivered to their homes eliminates the need for extensive travel.

## What the Website is Catering For

The Popular Website caters to students and individuals passionate about various interests, even those residing far from the city, providing them with the convenience of online shopping. Additionally, the website operates 24 hours a day without any person limit, enabling users to make purchases and search for items at any time. This continuous accessibility contributes to increased profits for the bookstore.

Moreover, the e-commerce nature of the website allows for a reduction in staff at the physical shop. The elimination of rush at the cashier during checkout is beneficial, providing a smoother transaction process. Customers no longer need to wait in queues, thereby enhancing customer service and overall shopping experience. This improved service encourages customers to return to our store.
